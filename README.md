# Job-portal-website-
This is our first group project

Introduction:

Job finder websites are important tools for people looking for work and businesses searching for employees. As more people search for jobs online, it's important to have a website that is easy to use and works well on all devices. This project aims to create a simple, user-friendly job finder website to help job seekers and employers connect easily.

Many job websites today have problems, like being hard to navigate or not working well on mobile phones. This makes it frustrating for people to search for jobs and apply. Some websites also make it difficult for companies to post job openings. These issues can lead to missed opportunities and frustrated users (Indeed, n.d.; Jobvite, 2020).

This project will create a clean and modern job finder website using HTML, CSS, and W3.CSS. The website will allow job seekers to search for jobs and apply easily, while employers can post job listings without trouble (CareerFoundry, 2022; UX Design Institute, n.d.).

The main goals of this project are: to build a job finder website that works on all devices; to design pages like a homepage with featured jobs, a job list, job details, employer dashboard, and contact page; to make the website easy to use with helpful features like job search and filters.

In conclusion, this project will solve the common problems people face with job websites by focusing on easy navigation and a clean design. This will help job seekers find work and employers find the right people more easily.
